        'PIA': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'PERFECTION. Led from start to finish. The M-H-H strategy provided the necessary flexibility to cover rivals and control the race without any scares. A flawless victory.' },
        'ALO': { strategy: 'S-H-H', analysis: 'THE STAR OF THE DAY. Used the aggressive strategy to execute the "undercut" of the season, gaining 10 positions. A masterclass in driving and tactics. Legendary.' },
        'NOR': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'INTELLIGENT AND EFFECTIVE. Quietly climbed through the field. The long initial stint kept him out of traffic and secured a well-deserved podium.' },
        'RUS': { strategy: 'S-H-H', analysis: 'DISAPPOINTING. Failed to convert P2. The S-H-H strategy left him vulnerable to Alonso\'s "undercut," and he lacked the pace to recover. Missed the podium.' },
        'BOR': { strategy: 'M-H', analysis: 'THE ABSOLUTE SURPRISE. The hero of the one-stop strategy. Drove with maturity, managed his tires like a veteran, and turned a P17 into a top 5 finish. Phenomenal.' },
        'LEC': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'INVISIBLE. Like Hamilton, his M-H-H strategy yielded no results. He was stuck in the pack and never seemed to have the pace to challenge at the front.' },
        'HAM': { strategy: 'S-H-H', analysis: 'LOST IN STRATEGY. Starting on Mediums with a planned S-H-H didn\'t work. Dropped 4 positions and had an anonymous race.' },
        'VER': { strategy: 'S-H-H', analysis: 'A BAD DAY. The aggressive strategy did not pay off. He was swallowed by the pack and lacked his usual dominant pace. A result well below expectations.' },
        'LAW': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'STRANGE, BUT SURVIVED. Starting on Hard tires made him slow at the beginning, losing positions. He recovered slightly, but the gamble wasn\'t worth it.' },
        'GAS': { strategy: 'S-H-H', analysis: 'SOLID WORK. Executed the same strategy as Alonso, but with less flair. Still, he gained 3 positions and salvaged a point for Alpine.' },
        'ANT': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'A LEARNING DAY. Couldn\'t make the strategy work and lost ground. Finished outside the points.' },
        'SAI': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'DAMAGE LIMITATION. Gained two positions on a tough day for those starting in the midfield. A decent race.' },
        'BEA': { strategy: 'M-H', analysis: 'GREAT EXECUTION. Like Bortoleto, he used the single stop to gain many positions. A P13 finish from last is an excellent result.' },
        'ALB': { strategy: 'M-H', analysis: 'GOOD JOB. Another one-stop driver who made the tactic work, gaining 5 positions.' },
        'TSU': { strategy: 'M-M-H', analysis: 'BIZARRE STRATEGY. The M-M-H plan was a disaster. He had no pace at any point and plummeted down the order.' },
        'HUL': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'NEUTRAL. Neither moved forward nor backward. His strategy didn\'t allow for any significant progress.' },
        'DOO': { strategy: 'M-H-H', analysis: 'THE GAMBLE DIDN\'T PAY OFF. The "Gamble" start on medium tires provided no advantage, and he ended up losing positions.' },
        'OCO': { strategy: 'M-H', analysis: 'LESS SUCCESSFUL. Of the one-stop drivers, he was the least successful, finishing where he started.' },
        'STR': { strategy: 'M-M-H', analysis: 'THE BIGGEST LOSER. A disastrous race. The M-M-H strategy was terrible, and he lost 9 positions. A day to forget completely.' },
        'HAD': { strategy: 'S-H-H', analysis: 'EARLY END. The grid\'s rising star had his race end on the first lap. Impossible to evaluate.' }
