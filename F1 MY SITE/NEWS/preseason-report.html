                <p>Three intense days of pre-season testing have concluded, and it's Ferrari who leave with the fastest time, but McLaren and Mercedes showed formidable pace, leaving many questions unanswered ahead of the season opener.</p>
                <p><strong>Headline Grabbers: Ferrari and McLaren</strong><br>Charles Leclerc ultimately set the fastest time of the entire test on the final afternoon, a blistering 1:33.208. The Ferrari looked stable, quick, and reliable, with both Leclerc and new teammate Lewis Hamilton racking up significant mileage. Close behind were McLaren, with Oscar Piastri topping the timesheets on Day 1. The team appears to have carried its strong momentum into the new season, looking like a genuine threat for victories from the outset.</p>
                <p><strong>Sleeping Giants? Red Bull & Mercedes</strong><br>Reigning champion Max Verstappen and Red Bull had a quiet test by their standards, focusing on long runs rather than headline-grabbing glory runs. The car looked planted and consistent, and the consensus in the paddock is that the true, fearsome pace of the Red Bull is yet to be unleashed. Similarly, Mercedes worked diligently through their program, with George Russell and rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli gathering crucial data. While not topping the charts, their pace on harder tires suggests they are holding their cards close to their chest.</p>
                <p><strong>Mileage Kings</strong><br>The reliability award for testing must go to rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli, who completed a staggering 326 laps over the three days, more than any other driver. This seat time will be invaluable for the young Italian as he prepares for his Grand Prix debut. Ferrari and Red Bull also demonstrated impressive reliability, completing their programs with minimal interruption.</p>
                <p>With testing complete, all eyes now turn to Australia. Has Ferrari truly leapfrogged the competition, or are Red Bull and Mercedes hiding their true potential? The first race of the season can't come soon enough.</p>
